    Cows with guns will raid your base! You can recruit them if you want, but they're terrible workers. They're cows.
	
	REQUIRES humanoid alien races: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=839005762 
	Load after humanoid alien races.
	
	Requires a new save. 
	
	This is not a serious mod. There are probably balance issues, tell me if you run into any trouble
